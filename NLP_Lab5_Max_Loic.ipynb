Recently I was thinking about home improvement, and one idea that is haunting me is that I could use some kind of refrigerator for gaming consoles and laptops. The obvious benefit is that it maintains a constant low temperature. Also, the doors usually can be closed firmly and it won't let dust come inside, so there isn't any need to disassemble and clean hardware. That is a good thing in long term. Despite it makes airflow less intensive, according to my understanding it should not be a problem, as all that is needed for hardware is cooled air, not new air. And whenever I get what I consider a good idea, I usually stop for a minute and ask myself a question \\\"why doesn\\'t this exist yet?\\\". So there are definitely big-scale expensive enterprise servers which could possibly use the same approach to reduce maintenance effort, but that is not the case. So the disadvantages I can think of is that refrigerators are just not designed to cool a source of constant heat for a long period of time and (probably) will break quickly. Another problem that came to mind is that refrigerator boxes tend to generate condensate and it might be harmful for hardware. Am I correct with my assumptions, or is it not that crucial and are there in fact similar solutions?\""

What sensor, using what physical principle, can penetrate a closed rectangular object like the trailer of a truck and tell if the space is empty or loaded? Why is this question relevant? One of the biggest problems of maintaining & building roads is to understand how much load is transported over that road per time increment. A loaded truck can bring much more damage to a road than many cars can (a 18 wheeler can have the impact of over nine thousand cars). Current in-road, at-speed weighing technology can cost millions. The reason for this questions is trying to find a way to use existing low cost sensors (or a combination of multiple sensors) at the roadside to assist with estimating the weight of a truck. If we know the truck/ trailer combination is empty or full, we typically know the lowest and maximum load weight. And then can estimate the average load on this road per time increment. This is much better than current vehicle counts and is commercially very interesting. Many thanks for staying on topic and trying to point me in the right direction. Initial thoughts: It is easy if you can visually see the load (like on a logging truck). It is hard if it is a closed curtainsider, bulk load or container truck from a stationary roadside measurement unit. Computer vision could be used to compare the bounce of the cab, analyze the suspension; use thermal camera to detect higher temperature of tyres or axis; acoustics of empty vs loaded. What other sensors/ physical principles should be tried like measure on an uphill stretch: slower truck of same vehicle class will be loaded truck. Again, many thanks for sharing your thoughts on what physical principle could be tried to tackle the problem to detect if a confined space is empty or filled, from the outside without weighing it. An approximation with an acceptable error rate is fine.\""

Essentially all server rooms and most spaces where PCs are located (speaking for the U.S., at least) are air conditioned. Server rooms almost universally have dedicated HVAC systems and they will indeed be designed to keep the room at a more-or-less constant temperature (and typically humidity, too.) Other answers mention water blocks, heat sinks, fans, etc., but those are mostly just used to move the heat from the CPUs and other such hot components to the ambient air in the server room. You still have to get rid of the heat from the ambient air and air conditioning is by far the most common solution for that. Incidentally, this is actually frequently one of the largest costs associated with running servers. It's not uncommon for the HVAC system for a large server room to use more power than the actual servers (or, at least, that was the case back when I was a sysadmin a decade ago. I'd guess it still is.) As a result, there have been experiments with more environmentally-friendly (i.e. energy-efficient) ways to cool server rooms, including even locating them underwater. These have had some success, but, obviously, they're quite a bit more complicated and geographically limiting than just installing air conditioning, so air conditioning is still by far the most common solution to cool server rooms.\""

The projection plane is like the film / sensor of a camera. It can be in any orientation, not necessarily parallel to the (global) XY plane. So the projection plane can intersect all three axes except in cases where the plane happens to be parallel to (global) XY or (global) YZ or (global) ZX plane. I used the qualifier \\\"global\\\" for the axes and the planes since one can define another set of XYZ axes where the X and Y axes lie on the projection plane (horizontal and vertical direction). In that frame, Z axis is by definition, perpendicular to the screen / projection plane. My question is how to visualize projection from 3D space to projection plane(2D) where diagonal(projection vector) makes equal angle with 3 principal axis ... Below are three images which may help you visualize the projection plane, the projection vector / direction and the projected image. The global X, Y ans Z axes are colored red, green and blue. The cube is aligned to the global axes. The projection plane is shown in translucent red square. The projected image of the cube is thick black lines. The projection direction is shown as thin teal line. Note that all the vertices are extended running parallel to the projection direction until they hit the projection plane. Projection plane is parallel to the XY plane. The cube appears as a square to when projected on the projection plane. Projection direction lies 45° to the Z and Y axes. Projection plane intersects Z and Y axes. The cube appears to be two rectangles when projected on to the plane. Projection direction is equal angle from all three axes; i.e., projection direction is the vector [1(√3),1(√3),1(√3)]T and the angle with each axis is 54.736°. Projection plane intersects all three axis at equal lengths (not visible in the figure attached). Note that, for this projection, the projection line passes through diagonally opposite corners of the cube. 1.projection along Z direction 2.projection along equal angles to Y and Z axes 3.projection along equal angles to all three axes EDIT I also read that Projection vector makes equal angles with all of the three principal axes... Please elaborate how you get [1/(√3),1/(√3),1/(√3)]T Let the projection vector be a unit vector n^=[a,b,c]T. The angle that each axis makes with this vector is given by the dot product. cosθ=x^⋅n^=[1,0,0]T⋅[a,b,c]T=acosψ=y^⋅n^=[0,1,0]T⋅[a,b,c]T=bcosϕ=z^⋅n^=[0,0,1]T⋅[a,b,c]T=ca=b=csinceθ≜ψ≜ϕ Since n^ is a unit vector, a2+b2+c2=12. So, a=b=c=13√. We can find this vector in another way also; aligning the projection vector with the cube diagonal The cube diagonal is [1,1,1]T. This vector has length 3–√. So the corresponding unit vector is [13√,13√,13√]T\""

It's much better to have results sooner than later. More powerful computers also allows us to consider more engineering design options and to evaluate the financials of each option. It allows a degree of optimization that was not possible years ago with lesser computers. Another way of looking at it is, for your next long distance driving holiday would you prefer to travel in a modern SUV with air conditioning, heating, enclosed cabin, modern suspension system, with a GPS, listening to whatever you want on the sound system, or would you prefer to travel in a Model T Ford from 1909, with its open cabin, no air conditioner, no sound system and slower top speed compared to a modern SUV? They are both cars, but one is much older and one is newer. You decide. By the way, you still only get 2 weeks holiday with either option.\""

Modern CPUs also have caches, memory management units, floating point and single instruction multiple data (SIMD) units. (Also nowadays you have multiple CPU cores in one CPU.) All those units may have their own bit size. E.g. the 68000 had a 16 bit data bus, 24 bit address bus, 32 bit registers and a 16 bit ALU (and none of the modern stuff). Historically, the processor classification in bits (8, 16, 32, 64 and so on) gives the size of the ALU. This means that an 8 bit processor can handle 8 bit of data in one cycle, a 16 bit processor 16 bit data and so on. This does not mean that they can't handle larger data, it just takes longer. E.g. the 68000 required two cycles to add two 32 bit values.\""

Then the first integrated circuits that had only a couple dozen transistors and were based on manually projected stencils. The computers would help a bit, but most of the work was done with pen on paper. What is now done by a single tiny chip was occupying a large board with a hundred integrated circuits - each designed by hand. Never mind precision of the process wouldn't allow more elements in an IC. At certain point, computers were advanced enough to implement CAD software. This allowed moving the design from paper to circuitry, applying common cut&paste to stuff several chips into one, then plot a large, complex mask on paper to be shrunk by photo-techniques and made into more complex chips. As these entered use, increasingly less of the process was done \\\"by hand\\\" and increasingly more was automated. Specialized software that allowed use of a high-level programming language to \\\"write\\\" the IC architecture, that compiled to paths and transistors without human interaction, robotic assembly lines that could prepare increasingly more complex masks etc. Think of it that way: you think the mask can't be made using anything less than it produces... are you sure? Can't it be made using something 5% less than it produces? And that one can't be made with something another 5% less complex?ps. you refer to 'cutting'. That's not how these stencils were made. They were about universally made using photo-etching. Make a (big) printout of a layer of the IC. Take a photo. Now your printout is the size of a microfiche. Spray silicone wafer with conductor, copper vapor or such. Spray that with photo-hardening emulsion. Shine UV light through the microfiche stencil with optics focusing it to the size of the IC. It hardens the emulsion where paths are to go. Apply acid bath, etching the conductor and emulsion away where they aren't needed. Wash the emulsion off....and so on. Different substances, different emulsions, different masks, layer by layer the chip was built in an entirely analog process.

The transition between states can be triggered asynchronously by inputs to the system (e.g. someone pushes a button to operate an automatic door). The finite state machine needs to have some logic elements to \\\"remember\\\" of what state it is currently in, but that does not have to be anything like the addressable memory used in digital computer system. It could simply be a set of mechanical switches and electrical relays. For example a mechanical combination lock is an example of an asynchronous finite state machine where the \\\"memory\\\" is just the physical positions of the different parts of the lock. To interface the real world inputs to a synchronous control system such as a digital computer, there are two basic techniques: either the computer program regularly polls the input devices to check what state they are in, or the input devices generate interrupts which force the program to jump to a different point and continue executing from there. Textbooks on computer system design explain both methods in detail.\""
